# Governance Charter

## Bodies & Roles
- **Steering Committee (5â€“7)**: sets roadmap; appoints Domain Owners/Auditors; ratifies MAJOR process changes.
- **Domain Owners**: Constitutional, Policy/Act, Academic/Methods, Data & Figures.
- **Independent Auditors**: rotate quarterly; cannot approve changes they authored.
- **Maintainers/Release**: ensure CI gates, tag releases, publish MANIFEST.

## Decision Rights & Merge Gates
- **PATCH**: Owner approval.
- **MINOR**: Owner + Auditor approval.
- **MAJOR**: Owner + Auditor + 48-hour public comment window.

## Conflict of Interest
- Authors may not approve their own PRs. A different Owner and an Auditor must approve.

## Cadence

## Succession
- Founding Maintainer hands Release Lead after 2 stable releases. Sunset veto after one quarter.
