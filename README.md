# R2L Foundation Repository

This repository is the **foundation** for the Right to Live (R2L) open policy engineering effort.
It contains governance, contribution standards, CI gates, and folder conventions for modular, auditable work.

**Core principles**: every claim maps to a DAM row; figures are reproducible (LDAI); releases are hashed and reversible.
